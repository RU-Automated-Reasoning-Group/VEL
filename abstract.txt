We implement the verification-guided learning framework 
VEL in this artifact. This artifact consists of two parts.
The first part is the code for programmatic reinforcement learning
algorithm from (Qiu and Zhu) to train programmatic controllers with 
high rewards. The second part is our implementation of the VEL framework.
Trained controllers are used for verification and 
verification-guided learning by the VEL code. All results 
presented in the paper, including both the figures and the table, 
can be reproduced using the provided scripts.
